# AWAKE: An AI-Powered 2D Platformer
**AWAKE** is a 2D platformer game where players awaken a dormant robot by describing its traits using natural language. The game dynamically generates a playable robot character based on the description, blending AI-driven customization with immersive game experience. 

## Features
- **AI-Generated Characters**: Describe your robotâ€™s abilities and personality, and watch it come to life.
- **Classic Platformer Gameplay**: Run, jump, dash, and battle monsters across multiple levels.
- **Post-Apocalyptic Narrative**: Help a dormant robot escape a melancholic, futuristic world.
- **Customizable Traits**: Every character is unique based on player-generated descriptions.

## How It Works
1. **Describe Your Robot**: Enter a natural language description (e.g., "An agile robot with powerful attacks").
2. **AI Processing**: The game uses an AI backend to transform your description into a set of character traits.
3. **Play**: Control your robot and navigate through levels filled with challenges and enemies.
